# Flexbones -  Wordpress Barebones Theme

Flexbones is a responsive starter theme. Flexible, simple and the CSS is under 10kb! It cleans up all the out of the box Wordpress bloat and leaves you with a clean, organised start to your project. The project has an MIT license and if you use it for anything I would love to hear about it know!
