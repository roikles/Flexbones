2. Overview
--------

Not another barebones theme! I built this to speed up the process of developing responsive wordpress themes. It uses SASS/ Compass and the Susy Grid system to allow speedy development.

The original Barebones theme contained everything and the kitchen sink, This time around I have removed as much uneccesary bloat as possible.

The included sass styles are focused on functional CSS rather than presentational CSS. Flexbones provides not only a responsive grid system but responsive images, typography and a responsive baseline grid!

Also bundled is our up coming browser tool Gridtacular that give at-a-glance information on the current page dimensions and breakpoint along with the ability to toggle both a grid overlay and a baseline grid overlay.
