Barebones Wordpress theme V2
=========

1. Overview
--------

Not another barebones theme! I built this to speed up the process of developing responsive wordpress themes (non responsive version to come). It uses SASS/ Compass and the Susy Grid system to allow speedy development.

The original Barebones contained everything and the kitchen sink, I kept updating one template fine and forgetting another so for this version I have stripped it all back to the bare essentials.

The stylesheet is where the magic happens and again it has been stripped back to give you a framework to quickly establish typography, responsive grids, forms and tables. The CSS is very minimal, this theme is not a plug and play solution but will speed up conveting concepts to production code that is flexible and maintainable.
